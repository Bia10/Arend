You need to have [JRE 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html) installed on your computer to use Arend.
Arend is available either as an [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) plugin (see [this section](#intellij-idea-plugin) for the installation instructions) or as a console applications (see [this section](#console-application) for the installation instructions).

# IntelliJ IDEA Plugin

To install the IntelliJ IDEA plugin, follow the instructions below.

* Download (either community or ultimate version of) [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea).
* Run Intellij IDEA, choose either **Configure | Plugins** if you are on a _Welcome screen_ or **File | Settings** from the main menu if a project is open, go to **Plugins** tab, search for _Arend_ plugin and install it, restart Intellij IDEA.
* Another way to get the latest version of the plugin is by following instructions on [this page](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-arend/blob/dev/README.md).
* There is a standard library, containing a number of essential definitions and proofs, in particular, in
 constructive algebra and homotopy theory. It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/arend-lib).

Let's create our first Arend project.

* Run Intellij IDEA and choose either **Create New Project** if you are on a _Welcome screen_ or **File | New | Project** from the main menu if a project is open.
* Choose **Arend** in the list on the left. If you want to use external libraries, for example, the standard library, 
you can set up the path to a directory with
these libraries in the panel on the right. In order to do this, click **+** button in the top left corner of the panel, select
**Arend libraries** and choose a path in the dialog.
* Click **Next**. In the successive steps set up the name of the project, directories for sources and binaries and click **Finish**. 
 
You should get a new project which contains (among other files) a file `arend.yaml` and an empty source directory 
(`src` by default).
The `yaml` file contains a description of the project.
You can read more about this configuration file [here](libraries).

If you want to use the standard library, you should add it to the list of dependencies in **File | Project Structure**.
In case you did not specify the path to Arend external libraries on creation of the project, you should do it in Project SDK
section of **File | Project Structure | Project**.  Once this is done, click **+** button on the right of the panel
**File | Project Structure | Modules**, select **Library | Arend library** and choose the libraries to be added as 
dependencies.

Create a new file `example.ard` in the source directory.
Add the following line to this file:
```arend
\func f => 0
```
Right click `example.ard` file and choose `Run 'Typecheck example'` in the popup menu (you can also use shortcut `<Alt+Shift+F10>`).
You should see the message _All Tests Passed_, which indicates that the typechecking was successful.
Modify the file as follows:
```arend
\func f : Nat -> Nat => 0
```
Run the typechecking again (you can use shortcut `<Shift+F10>` for this).
You should see the following error message:
```bash
[ERROR] example.ard:1:25: Type mismatch
  Expected type: Nat -> Nat
    Actual type: Nat
  In: 0
  While processing: f
```

To learn more about Arend, see the [language reference](language-reference).

# Console Application

To install the console application, follow the instructions below.

* Download the arend [jar file](http://valis.github.io/arend.jar). You can also get the latest version of the plugin by following instructions on [this page](https://github.com/JetBrains/arend/blob/master/README.md).
* Run `java -jar arend.jar` to check that everything is alright. You should see the following output:
<pre><code class="bash">$ java -jar arend.jar
[INFO] Loading library prelude
[INFO] Loaded library prelude
Nothing to load
</code></pre>
To see command line options, run `java -jar arend.jar --help`.

Let's create our first Arend project.
Create a directory for your project:
```bash
$ mkdir testProject
$ cd testProject
```
Create file `arend.yaml` inside this directory.
This file contains the description of your project.
Currently, we just need to specify the location of source files of your project.
You can read more about this configuration file [here](libraries).
Add the following line to `arend.yaml`:
```bash
sourcesDir: src
```
Create directory `src` which will contain source files for this project.
Create a file `example.ard` inside `src` with the following content:
```arend
\func f => 0
```
Run `java -jar $arend $myProject`, where `$arend` is the path to `arend.jar` and `$myProject` is the path to `arend.yaml`.
You should see the following output:
```bash
[INFO] Loading library prelude
[INFO] Loaded library prelude
[INFO] Loading library myProject
[INFO] Loaded library myProject
--- Typechecking myProject ---
[ ] example
--- Done ---
```
This means that module `example` was successfully typechecked.
Modify file `example.ard` as follows:
```arend
\func f : Nat -> Nat => 0
```
If you run `java -jar $arend $myProject` again, it should produce the following error message:
```bash
[INFO] Loading library prelude
[INFO] Loaded library prelude
[INFO] Loading library myProject
[INFO] Loaded library myProject
--- Typechecking myProject ---
[ERROR] example:1:25: Type mismatch
  Expected type: Nat -> Nat
    Actual type: Nat
  In: 0
  While processing: f
[âœ—] example
Number of modules with errors: 1
--- Done ---
```
